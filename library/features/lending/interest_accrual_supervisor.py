# This module implements interest accrual differently for supervisors, as they do not have
# access to optimised data fetching in scheduled_hook yet. As a result, the approach taken for
# contracts is not performant as it requires fetching a month balance timeseries in order to
# differentiate emi and non-emi interest. Instead, two separate addresses are used. This is
# identical in most scenarios, except where the due amount calculation day changes and what was
# originally emi interest becomes non-emi interest, or vice-versa. This scenario is not handled
# for supervisors.
