# Markdown

## Linting / Formatting

We use `markdownlint` in the pre-commit hook to consistently and effortlessly lint and format our markdown files.

### Why

Formatting can be a divisive and remarkably time-consuming activity. These tools remove the subjectivity and effort, and guarantee a high level of consistency.

### How

The `markdownlint` will run automatically during the pre-commit hook on any affected markdown files. It will fix any simple fixes and report any errors which require manual resolution. The extensions `DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint` and `darkriszty.markdown-table-prettify` are included in the recommended extensions pack which will help with ensuring that markdown errors are raised and fixed before commit time (if configured in such a way).

Configuration for the `markdownlint` tool is set in `.markdownlint.json`
