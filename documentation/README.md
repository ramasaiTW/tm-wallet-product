The best practices and standards documentation is mastered in this repository and synced to Confluence. In order to preserve a readable structure in Confluence, it relies on some pre-existing pages:

- Smart Contract Best Practices (Inc)
  - Smart Contract Style Guides
  - Smart Contract Implementation Guides
  - Smart Contract Testing
  - Smart Contract Design Decisions

There are no specific requirements on those confluence pages per-se, but it makes sense to set them up to show a list of child pages, or display content by label. Note that the `(Inc)` for the top-level page is a temporary measure to let the existing page co-exist during the transition.
